## Backend setup:
1. Clone GitHub repository.

2. Run 
```
npm install
```
in root folder.

3. Create `.env` file by copying `.env.template`.
2. Setup database.
   1. Install PostgreSQL globally using method of choice, depending on your system.

   2. Log in as user `postgres`.
   3. Create user.
   4. Crease database for development and production.
   5. Give new user permissions to database.
   6. Write down credentials into `.env` file.
   7. You can manage your database and its settings using one of many apps to manage SQL db, ie: \
   *[pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/)*
1. Run 
    ```
    npm run devstart
    ```
    The server will start on [*http://localhost:5000*](http://localhost:5000)

2. Check backend operation (GET, POST, PUT) by invoking testing functions from `/utils` folder.\
   You can also check RestAPI operation using `curl` in console or using tools like: *[Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)*

3. If you need API only to use with your own frontend, just end here, remove `Frontend` directory and deploy the app.
