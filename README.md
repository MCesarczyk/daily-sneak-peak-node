2. Setup database.
   1. Install PostgreSQL globally using method of choice, depending on your system.

   2. Log in as user `postgres`.
   3. Create user.
   4. Crease database for development and production.
   5. Give new user permissions to database.
   6. Write down credentials and also database name into `.env` file.
   7. Install pg-migrator globally
      ```
      npm install -g pg-migrator
      ```
   8. Go to `/sql/migrate` directory.
   9. Roll migrations

      $ pg-migrator postgres://username:password@localhost/daily_sneak_peak_development
      (daily_sneak_peak_production)
      ```
3. Run Node server
    ```
    npm run devstart
    ```
    The server will start on [*http://localhost:5000*](http://localhost:5000)

4. Check backend operation (GET, POST, PUT) by invoking testing functions from `/utils` folder.\
   You can also check RestAPI operation using `curl` in console or using tools like: *[Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)*

5. If you need API only to use with your own frontend, just end here, remove `Frontend` directory and deploy the app.
